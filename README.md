# HumidOSH
The HumidOSH is a self-contained environmental chamber with controls for relative humidity and fan speed. This respository contains the **source code** of the Arduino sketch/program that should be uploaded to the Arduino Nano in the control box of each HumidOSH unit. The full HumidOSH repository containing bill of materials and links to other components of the system can be found at https://osf.io/wckhm/.

**NOTE: If you only need the compiled Arduino sketch/program** (quick & easy method), please visit https://osf.io/m8wek/. The instructions on downloading are given on the Wiki in that page.

## Installation
Click the green "Clone or download button" on this webpage (it's at the top right of the big list of files) and click "Download ZIP." Extract the files somewhere on your computer. If you have the Arduino IDE installed, open "HumidOSH.ino" and upload the program to your Arduino Nano. Tutorial for Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage
