# HumidOSH
The HumidOSH is a self-contained environmental chamber with controls for relative humidity and fan speed. This respository contains the Arduino code that should be uploaded to the Arduino Nano in the control box of each HumidOSH unit. The full repository containing bill of materials and links to other components of the system can be found at https://osf.io/wckhm/.

## Installation
**NOTE**: Before proceeding, make sure you have read the build instructions at **TBD** and decide if you want to proceed with "Quick & easy" (compiled hex file) or the "Advanced method" (Arduino library).
 - **Quick & easy**: Download the compiled hex file from https://osf.io/m8wek/. The instructions on downloading are given on the Wiki in that page. Upload the hex file into your Arduino Nano by following Step 56 in the build instructions.
 - **Advanced**: Click the green "Clone or download button" on this webpage (it's at the top right of the big list of files) and click "Download ZIP." Extract the files somewhere on your computer. If you have the Arduino IDE installed, open "TDTSandwich.ino" and upload the program to your Arduino Nano. Tutorial for Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage
